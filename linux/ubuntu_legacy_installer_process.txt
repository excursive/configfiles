Process for avoiding bugs in ubuntu legacy intsaller:

Clear old home dirs
Set up /home and /tmp encrypted ext4 partitions in Gnome Disks
Delete all other partitions
In installer (don't reboot):
  change /home
  change /tmp
  create esp
  create /boot
  create encrypted volume for /
  change /
After install, fix crypttab and fstab before restarting!
